# Grocery-List
A place to store and manage your groceries.

When you run the script you are going to be asked to insert a number based on the menu provided that will make a selection that changes your grocery list. 
There are eight different options. Add, view, mark completed, remove a item, remove all items, sort alphabetically, print # of items, or quit program. 
If you choose to add an item, you will be asked to type what item you would like to add.
If you choose to mark an item as completed, you have to pick the position of the item for which you want to complete. Remember that the position starts at 0 and goes up from there. 
If you chose to remove an item, you will be asked to type what item you would like to remove.
